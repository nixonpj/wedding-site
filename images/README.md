## Image Tips:

- Use high-quality images (JPG, PNG, or SVG format)
- SVG format is best for decorative elements (scalable, crisp at any size)
- For best results, use images with good contrast
- Images will be automatically resized and centered
- The overlay ensures text remains readable over any image
- Decorative elements should work with the whitish color theme

   - `welcome-bg.jpg` (or `.png`)
   - `decorative-left.svg` (or `.png`) - optional
