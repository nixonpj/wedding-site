## How We Met

We met in graduate school at the University of Chicago in the winter of 2019. Although we were mutually indifferent to each other at first, Smrithi quickly realized that she needed a study partner. We stayed friends throughout school and eventually went our separate ways when Nixon moved to Seattle and Smrithi to New York City.


## The First Date

There was no first date. Neither of us know when we started dating. So we have retroactively declared Setptember 2022 to be the dawn of our relationship.


## Growing Together

We grew together first in New York, and later continents apart when Smrithi returned to India in 2023. Despite the uncertainties of immigration and the long distance, our love only grew stronger. The distance taught us that what matters most is being together—no matter where in the world we are.


## Our Future

We're excited to start this new chapter of our lives together, surrounded by our family and friends. Our wedding is not just a celebration of our steadfast love, but also of our perseverance and growth together every single day.
