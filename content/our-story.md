## How We Met

They met in Grad school at the University of Chicago in the winter of 2019 where despite their mutual indifference to each other's presence, Smrithi was quick to realize she needed Nixon as a study partner. They stayed friends through school and parted ways with Nixon moving to Seattle and Smrithi to New York City. 

## The First Date

There was no first date. No one really knows how they started dating. All we know is that their friendship started to grow into something more meaningful sometime in the fall of 2022. 


## Growing Together

Over the years, they grew together first in NYC and later continents apart after Smrithi returned to India in 2023. The distance was no hindrance to their love and aspiration to stay together. 


## Our Future

We're excited to start this new chapter of our lives together, surrounded by our family and friends. Our wedding is not just a celebration of our steadfast love, our perseverance and our growth together every single day.
