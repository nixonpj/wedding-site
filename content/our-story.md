## How We Met

Our story began in the most unexpected of places. It was a warm evening in Bangalore when our paths first crossed. What started as a casual conversation quickly turned into hours of talking, laughing, and discovering how much we had in common.

## The First Date

Our first official date was at a cozy café in the heart of the city. We talked about everything - our dreams, our families, our favorite books, and our shared love for travel. That evening, we both knew something special had begun.

## Growing Together

Over the years, we've shared countless adventures, from weekend trips to nearby hill stations to quiet evenings at home. We've supported each other through challenges and celebrated each other's successes. Every moment has brought us closer together.

## The Proposal

On a beautiful evening at Nandi Hills, surrounded by the golden sunset, one of us got down on one knee. The answer was an immediate and joyful "yes!" That moment marked the beginning of our journey toward forever.

## Our Future

We're excited to start this new chapter of our lives together, surrounded by our family and friends. Our wedding is not just a celebration of our love, but a promise to continue growing, learning, and loving each other every single day.
